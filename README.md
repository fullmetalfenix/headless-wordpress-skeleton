# headless-wordpress-skeleton
Barebones two file headless wordpress setup using react via cdn that should take only a minute or two to set up. 

## Step one:
drop the index.html in the root
 - CDN for React / Babel included
 - Application container 
 
## Step two:
drop the 'react-stuff' folder into the current theme folder*
 
 *Why did I do it this way? Beceause then I can go into the wordpress dash and edit my application code in the theme editor. This is just to play around with for now so I like the option to do everything through the WP admin area
